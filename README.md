## Description

This repository contains an implementation of neural network built from scratch using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The task included:
- Training the neural network
- Visualizing training loss and accuracy
- Evaluating performance on test data
- Testing the model on randomly selected test images

## Technologies

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Keras (MNIST dataset)**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Functionality

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
- Building a fully connected neural network manually
- Loss and accuracy tracking
- Training progress logging every 100 steps
- Plotting training:
   - Loss curve
   - Accuracy curve
- Evaluating the trained model on test data
- Generating:
   - Overall test accuracy
   - Full classification report 
- Testing the neural network on randomly selected images and displaying predictions
